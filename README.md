**WINDOWS 10 HOME IS THE DEFAULT!** If you do *not* have Windows 10 Home, press the Settings icon in the upper-right, and then select your preferred version of Windows.

Once the correct version is selected, press the Start button and the program will activate Windows! Some dialog boxes will popup, just click `OK`. These can give extra information about the activation.

Changing the **UI Update Rate** slider will change the rate at which the RAM and CPU stats refresh. This interval is from `100ms` to `1000ms`.

*Experimental:* **Realtime UI** will make the `Available Memory` control update as soon as a change is detected, hence *Realtime*.
